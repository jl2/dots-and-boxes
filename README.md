This is a [Dots and Boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes) game written in Common Lisp.

The game allows two people to play against each other, human vs computer, and computer vs computer.

Right now the computer chooses edges randomly, but I plan to improve its technique.

The game is currently played at the REPL, but eventually I will add a Qt GUI front end.
